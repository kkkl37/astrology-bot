As the moon drifts into Gemini and the sector of your chart that governs higher thinking, you'll notice your perspective shift as wisdom blossoms. Use this energy to look beyond yourself and your current situation, sweet Libra, peering beyond the veil to receive guidance and blessings from the divine. The desire to reinvent yourself and grow as a creative will be pronounced when Luna blows a kiss to Pluto, encouraging you to evolve into something bigger. You'll have a chance to merge spirituality with romance or self-care later tonight when Venus activates to promote harmony and soul fulfillment.

libra,love,"
One of the most important periods of the year for partnership has arrived, Libra. Mental Mercury, the planet of the mind and communication, will slowly take the hand of the sun and join in a sweet embrace. This will take place directly across the sky from you in your solar seventh house of partnerships. This means that if you'd like to have a heart-to-heart, make a promise, finalize an agreement, or truly see eye to eye, the two of you could forge a pact that lasts forever. If single, use this energy to set up dates with suitors who possess long-term potential and are also looking for the one."""
